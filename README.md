# Univariate-hierarchical-models-in-Stan-
This repository contains a simulation code for fitting Hierarchical models with different parametrizations and variable transformations. The two parametrizations are the hierarchical centering parametrization (HCP) and hierarchical non centering parametrization model.  We fit the models with raw, centered and standardized variables.
