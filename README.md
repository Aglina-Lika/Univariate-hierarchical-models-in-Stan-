# Univariate-hierarchical-models-in-Stan-
This repository contains a simulation code for fitting Hierarchical models with different parametrizations and variable transformations. The two parametrizations are the hierarchical centering parametrization (HCP) and hierarchical non centering-parametrization.  We fit the models with raw, centered and standardized variables. 

In the folder Stan model you can find the Stan codes for fitting the model with the use of the commant rstan in R. We provide as well 2 extra files. The extractFrames_new  is a function that everytime provides as the tables that are required for a specific parametrization and variable transformation. The file simExp_linear contains the code for the simulation of 100 data set for every combination of the parameters, the parametrizations and the variable transformations.
